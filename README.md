# Nova

## Project Description

Nova is a real-time multiplayer game set in outer space, where up to eight players compete to dominate a galaxy of stars. Each player starts with a home star and can take various actions to expand their control and eliminate other players.

## Gameplay

### Actions

Players can perform the following actions at any time:
- **Send ships** from one star to another.
- **Build factories** on a star.
- **Purchase range** to extend the reach of their ships.
- **Purchase speed** to make their ships travel faster.
- **Purchase a spy shield** to protect a star from espionage.
- **Purchase a bomb shield** to protect a star from attacks.

### Resources

Each star produces resources that can be used to:
- Build ships
- Construct factories
- Increase range and speed
- Create spies and bombs
- Build spy shields and bomb shields

### Objective

The goal of the game is to destroy all other players. A player is eliminated when all of their stars are destroyed.

## Mechanics

### Travel

- **Travel Time**: The time it takes for ships to travel between stars is determined by the distance and the player's speed. Ships travel at the player's current speed and this speed does not change mid-flight.
- **Visibility**: Ships are invisible while traveling between stars and only become visible when they arrive at a star.

### Spies

- **Visibility**: Spies are invisible while traveling and only become visible when they arrive at a star.
- **Function**: Spies can reveal the number of ships at a star, what is being built, and whether the star has a spy shield or bomb shield. Once a spy transmits this information back to the player, it disappears.

### Factories

- **Production**: Factories produce resources. The more factories a star has, the more resources it produces.

### Battles

When ships from different players meet at a star, a battle occurs. The battle is resolved in rounds with the following rules:
- The odds start at 60-40 in favor of the defender.
- If the attacker has 50% or more ships, the odds are 50/50.
- If the defender has 50% or more ships, the odds are 70/30.
- Each player's chances are multiplied by their battle power.
- Ties always go to the defender.

## Conclusion

Nova is a dynamic and strategic game that requires players to manage resources, plan their moves, and engage in tactical battles to achieve victory. Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
